                                    a logon request from the client, the server creates a nonce (a number used once) as a challenge mechanism and sends it to the client. The client adds a shared secret to the nonce and calculates a hash value from the
                                    combined data, which is next sent to the server. At the receiving end, the server performs the same calculation (one-way hash on the combined shared secret and nonce), and if the resulting hash value matches the one
                                    received from the client, the client is authenticated. Once the client is authenticated, CHAP periodically sends a new challenge to the client at random intervals in order to prevent session hijacking. If an attacker
                                    disconnects the legitimate client and authenticates himself to the server with the intercepted hash, he won't be able to calculate the correct hash value when the server challenges the client with the different nonce

                                    may be known by the public; private keys are kept secret. Anyone can verify the signature by employing the signatory’s public key. Only the user that possesses the private key can perform signature generation. A hash
                                    function is used in the signature generation process to obtain a condensed version of the data to be signed; the condensed version of the data is often called a message digest. The message digest is input to the digital
                                    signature algorithm to generate the digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed
                                    data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation, since the signatory cannot easily

                                    scanners, and other devices. Depending on the standard, SCSI bus can provide support for up to 7 (narrow SCSI) or 15 devices (wide SCSI). Through the use of port expanders, newer SCSI interfaces (such as Serial Attached
                                    SCSI (SAS)) can extend this number to many more supported devices. Devices on the SCSI bus communicate with the PC through the SCSI bus controller, which can be integrated on the motherboard or attached to the SCSI
                                    chain on an expansion card (also referred to as host adapter, or Host Bus Adapter (HBA)). Since the adapter device is just another device in the SCSI chain, it can be placed anywhere on the cable. Each device on a SCSI
                                    bus is assigned a number from 0 to 15 called SCSI ID, by means of jumpers, DIP switches, dials on the device, or software settings. The host adapter is generally assigned a number larger than all other devices, either
                                    7 or 15 (SCSI ID doesn't need to reflect the position of the device on the cable). SCSI ID identifies the physical device, which in some cases can have several logical devices embedded in it (e.g. in the case of a tape-backup
                                    jukebox which can have a tape changing device and multiple drives/slots to hold tape cartridges). To identify and address logical devices, each logical device is assigned a Logical Unit Number (LUN). SCSI chain requires
                                    termination, which prevents bouncing back of the signal and data corruption. As a rule, there must be no more than two, and no less than two terminators, and termination on the bus must be present only at the beginning
                                    of the SCSI bus, and at the end of the SCSI bus.</p>

                                    (e.g., a message or a file) and outputs a fixed-length output, which typically is much shorter than most input values. The hash value is sometimes called the message digest or simply digest. Hash functions are based
                                    on the one-way property which means that it is easy to apply hash function to data and produce a digest, but it's impossible (or very difficult) to recreate the original data from the result of the hash function alone.
                                    In case there's any change to data after the original hash was taken, the resulting hash taken after modification will be different from the original hash. This feature allows for application of hashing functions in
                                    verifying integrity of files and messages, e.g. by comparing message digests calculated before and after transmission it is possible to determine whether any changes have been made to a message or a file integrity in
                                    transit. The SHA algorithms are distinguished as SHA-0, SHA-1, and SHA-2, with SHA-1 being the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions (SHA-1 produces a 160-bit message digest). The SHA algorithms are called
                                    secure because of their on-way property, i.e. because of the assumption that it is computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a given message digest (brute force attacks that try to exploit this
                                    feature are called preimage attacks), or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest (when this occurs, it is referred to as a collision, and finding two different messages that produce the

                                    devices such as routers, bridges, switches, servers, printers, copiers, fax machines, and other network-attached devices. An SNMP-managed network consists of three key components: a managed device, a network-management
                                    software module that resides on a managed device (Agent), and a network management system (NMS) which executes applications that monitor and control managed devices and collect SNMP information from Agents. All SNMP-compliant
                                    devices include a virtual database called Management Information Base (MIB) containing information about configuration and state of the device that can be queried by the SNMP management station. The manager receives
                                    notifications (Traps and InformRequests) on UDP port 162. The SNMP Agent receives requests on UDP port 161, and before answering a request from SNMP manager, SNMP Agent verifies that the manager belongs to an SNMP community
                                    with access privileges to the Agent. An SNMP community is a group that consists of SNMP devices and one or more SNMP managers. The community has a name, and all members of a community have the same access privileges.
                                    An SNMP device or Agent may belong to more than one SNMP community and it will not respond to requests from management stations that do not belong to one of its communities. The relationship between SNMP server system

                                    the client's identity to the server), and also enable them, before the application protocol transmits or receives data, to negotiate a symmetric encryption algorithm and secret session key (to use for data confidentiality
                                    service) and a keyed hash (to use for data integrity service). SSL operates at the Session Layer of the OSI model.</p>

                                    subsystem typically requires a user to log in once at the beginning of a session, and then during the session transparently grants access by the user to multiple, separately protected hosts, applications, or other system
                                    resources, without further login action by the user. Such a subsystem has the advantages of being user friendly and enabling authentication to be managed consistently across an entire enterprise. Such a subsystem also
                                    has the disadvantage of requiring all the accessed components to depend on the security of the same authentication information. One of the more important SSO implementations is Kerberos. SSO can also be implemented

                                <p><b>Transport Layer Security</b>. The TLS protocol provides communications security over the Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering,
                                    or message forgery. The primary goal of the TLS protocol is to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. The protocol is composed of two layers: the TLS Record Protocol and the TLS Handshake
                                    Protocol. The TLS Record Protocol provides connection security that has two basic properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The connection is private. Symmetric cryptography is used for data encryption (e.g. AES, RC4, etc.). The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a secret negotiated
                                        by another protocol (such as the TLS Handshake Protocol). The Record Protocol can also be used without encryption.</li>
                                    <li>The connection is reliable. Message transport includes a message integrity check using a keyed Message Authentication Code (MAC.) Secure hash functions (e.g. SHA-1, etc.) are used for MAC computations. The Record Protocol
                                        can operate without a MAC, but is generally only used in this mode while another protocol is using the Record Protocol as a transport for negotiating security parameters.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The TLS Record Protocol is used for encapsulation of various higher-level protocols. One such encapsulated protocol, the TLS Handshake Protocol, allows the server and client to authenticate each other and to negotiate an
                                    encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys before the application protocol transmits or receives its first byte of data. The TLS Handshake Protocol provides connection security that has three basic properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The peer's identity can be authenticated using asymmetric, or public key, cryptography (e.g. RSA, DSA, etc.). This authentication can be made optional, but is generally required for at least one of the peers.</li>
                                    <li>The negotiation of a shared secret is secure: the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers, and for any authenticated connection the secret cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who can place himself in the
                                        middle of the connection.</li>
                                    <li>The negotiation is reliable: no attacker can modify the negotiation communication without being detected by the parties to the communication.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>One advantage of TLS is that it is application protocol independent. Higher-level protocols can layer on top of the TLS protocol transparently. The TLS standard, however, does not specify how protocols add security with
                                    TLS; the decisions on how to initiate TLS handshaking and how to interpret the authentication certificates exchanged are left to the judgement of the designers and implementors of protocols that run on top of TLS. Transport
                                    Layer Security was designed as a replacement for SSL. TLS is based on, and very similar to, SSL, but they are not interoperable.</p>

                                    pair are twisted around each other in order to reduce signal interference from adjacent wire pairs (effect known as crosstalk). UTP cable is not surrounded by any shielding that would provide protection against Electromagnetic
                                    Interference (EMI) / Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from outside sources. Another disadvantage is that UTP cabling must comply with specific requirements related to the twist rate (pulling or bending the cable can

                                    of their physical location. VLAN membership can be configured through software instead of physically relocating devices or connections, and VLANs are often created with the use of switches equipped with additional software
                                    features. By default, all ports on a switch are typically labeled as VLAN1, and virtual networks are created by changing this assignment (labeling one of the ports as VLAN2, another as VLAN3, etc.). Multiple switches
                                    on a LAN can be configured this way, and physically dispersed hosts that connect to e.g. VLAN2 port on any of those switches become a part of a single logical subnet. VLAN membership can be set either through switch
                                    ports, where a device connecting to a certain switch port automatically becomes a member of the VLAN assigned to that port (static VLAN), or through mapping the VLAN membership with the MAC address of the device connected
                                    to the port (dynamic VLAN). Dynamic VLANs are configured through the use of server software that relies on a database containing MAC-address-to-VLAN mappings. When a device connects to the dynamic port on a switch its
                                    MAC address is sent to the server, and if the matching entry in its database is found the server sends the VLAN number for that port. Data from multiple VLANs on single switch is carried through a single network link
                                    between switches. This is often referred to as "trunking" or "VLAN multiplexing", and each of the switches has a special port (trunk port) configured to pass all the data, regardless of the VLAN number, between all

                                <p><b>Wired Equivalent Privacy</b>. A security protocol introduced as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) communication. WEP was based on the use of the same shared
                                    private encryption key (or limited set of rotating keys) among all stations on a WLAN. This meant that if the key from a single station was compromised, the entire WLAN encryption scheme was compromised. Also, a weakness
                                    in how WEP was implemented allowed it to be cracked by public domain tools (e.g. WepAttack, AirCrack, etc.) by an attacker capturing packets passively. Furthermore, the flawed implementation also meant that increasing
                                    the key size from the available 40-bit exportable or 104-bit domestic options did not increase the difficulty in breaking the key exponentially, only linearly. Thus, simply increasing the key size was not an effective
                                    way to improve security. These weaknesses, combined with the lack of key management for distributing and updating keys on all WLAN stations and access points, made WEP security inadequate for protecting wireless networks
                                    and difficult to manage. WEP was replaced by an interim security solution referred to as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). The two key components of WPA, TKIP and 802.1x, addressed the primary problems with the original
                                    802.11 security model based on WEP. WPA interim standard was replaced by Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2), also referred to as 802.11i (the two terms, 802.11i and WPA2, are used synonymously to mean the new security
                                    standard for 802.11 networks).</p>
